https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/food-network-kitchen/tilapia-with-escarole-and-lemon-pepper-oil-recipe-1972910

Ingredients

1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil
12 ounces baby fingerling potatoes, halved, or small red-skinned potatoes, quartered
4 cloves garlic, smashed
1 head escarole (about 1 1/4 pounds), torn into pieces
Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper
1 1/4 pounds tilapia fillets, patted dry
2 sprigs fresh oregano, leaves torn

Directions

1. Heat 1/4 cup of the olive oil in a large deep skillet with a lid over
medium heat. Place the potatoes in the pan cut-side down. Add the
garlic and cook until the potatoes are slightly golden and crisp, 4 to
5 minutes. Add the escarole, season with salt and pepper, then add
about 1/3 cup water. Cover and steam until the escarole wilts, about 5
minutes.

2. Season the fish with salt and pepper; place on top of the greens in
the pan and sprinkle with the oregano leaves. Cover and steam until
the fish is just cooked through, about 5 more minutes.

3. Meanwhile, whisk the lemon juice in a bowl with the remaining 1/4 cup
olive oil; season with 1 teaspoon salt and plenty of pepper.

4. Carefully lift the fish off the greens and transfer to rimmed plates
or bowls. Distribute the greens, potatoes and pan juices around the
fish. Drizzle with the lemon-pepper oil.
